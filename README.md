# Duets ðŸŽ¸

Duets will be a music simulation focused on allowing the player to be the leader of their own band, composing songs and making gigs to become a star.

# ðŸ›  Run it locally

Running the game locally is rather simple if you have previous experience with any other JavaScript project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/duets/game.git duets
cd duets
npm install
npm run electro:dev # Runs the game in full-screen.
npm run electron:dev-windowed # Runs the game in window mode.
```

# ðŸ§ª Testing

The game has a basic set of tests right now that you can run with the integrated NPM command:

```bash
npm test
```

# ðŸ˜„ Contributions

Right now the game is in concept phase and it'll probably change quickly until it has certain features so there's no public roadmap. The best way of contributing right now is running the game and reporting bugs, if you want to contribute to the code check the project a little bit later, I'll update this section as soon as it's possible to have external contributions!
