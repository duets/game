# Duets ðŸŽ¸

Duets will be a music simulation focused on allowing the player to be the leader of their own band, composing songs and making gigs to become a star.

# ðŸ›  Run it locally

Duets is built with Rust. Right now the game only has a basic CLI for interacting with it. Once the game logic is done I'll start implementing a UI for it.

You can clone and run the CLI with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/duets/game.git duets
cd duets
cargo run -p cli
```

You need Rust to run this. You can follow the installation details [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

# ðŸ§ª Testing

You can run the tests with:

```bash
cargo test
```

# ðŸ˜„ Contributions

Right now the game is in concept phase and it'll probably change quickly until it has certain features so there's no public roadmap. The best way of contributing right now is running the game and reporting bugs, if you want to contribute to the code check the project a little bit later, I'll update this section as soon as it's possible to have external contributions!
