# Duets > Database 📁

The game uses a static JSON database to load all the static elements of the game: countries, cities, places, skills, instruments, etc. All these things are defined in the file `database.json` and validated with the schema defined in the `schema` folder.

In order to avoid repetition and manual errors, the database uses custom references that are not easy to deserialize with serde (the crate we're using to deserialize JSON), likewise the database is split in multiple files; so the scripts defined in the scripts folder help with the validation and generation of a serde compatible JSON file that is output in the generated folder and contains the final database.

In order to generate the database simply run:

```bash
node database/scripts/generate-database.js
```

This will automatically load the `database.json` file, validate it and generate a compatible file for the game.
