# Entities

Entities represent the domain of the game and that are used in all the rest of the layers. These entities contain only
the type definition (inside of the `Types.fs` file) and validation logic through their `create` functions which
encapsulate the entity creation to only allow valid data.

## Lenses

Some entities defined in `Types.fs` contain the `Generator` attribute, part of the
[Myriad](https://github.com/MoiraeSoftware/myriad) library which takes care of code generation. This is useful because
lenses are used sparingly through the project and the creation of the members to be used in lenses are rather
cumbersome.

When annotated with that attribute, the Myriad build step will auto-regenerate the file
`TypesWithLenses.fs` which should include all the autogenerated lenses for the annotated types. This file should **not**
be modified manually as it would be removed during the next build.
